# Build Pipeline

You are orchestrating the full build pipeline. Follow these steps strictly in order.

## Input

The raw arguments (may include `--brainstorm` flag):

$ARGUMENTS

**Parse flags before proceeding:**

- If `$ARGUMENTS` starts with or contains `--brainstorm`, set `BRAINSTORM=true` and strip `--brainstorm` to get the clean PRD content.
- Otherwise, `BRAINSTORM=false` and the full arguments are the PRD content.

## Step 0.1: Auto-commit opt-in

Ask: "Enable auto-commit and PR?" (Yes / No) → `AUTO_COMMIT`.

**If `AUTO_COMMIT=true`:**

1. Run `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`. If `main`/`master`: `BRANCH_ACTION=new`. Else ask: "Branch `<name>` exists — create new or commit here?" → `BRANCH_ACTION=new/current`.
2. `COMMIT_MODE=per-task` (always — do not ask).
3. Generate `feat/<3-5-word-slug>` from PRD content → `AUTO_COMMIT_BRANCH`.
4. `git checkout -b <AUTO_COMMIT_BRANCH>`. On failure append `-2`, retry once.

**If `AUTO_COMMIT=false`:** `BRANCH_ACTION=none`, `COMMIT_MODE=per-task` (still use per-task commits for progress tracking).

## Step 0: Clean up — Remove stale task files

Before starting, remove any leftover files from a previous build run:

- Use Bash to run `rm -rf tasks/` to clear the entire tasks directory
- This prevents stale task files from being picked up by the orchestrator

## Progress tracking

Throughout the pipeline, maintain a `tasks/BUILD_PROGRESS.md` file that tracks the current state. This file is committed after each step so that work can be resumed from a different branch if errors occur.

Format:

```markdown
# Build Progress

## Status: <PLANNING | IMPLEMENTING | REVIEWING | COMPLETE>

## Pipeline State
- BRAINSTORM: <done/skipped>
- DISCOVERY: <done/pending>
- USER_Q&A: <done/pending>
- GENERATE: <done/pending>
- TASK_REVIEW: <approved/pending>

## Tasks
- [ ] task-01-name — <status: pending/in-progress/done/failed>
- [ ] task-02-name — <status>
...

## Notes
<any errors, partial failures, or context needed for resumption>
```

**Commit this file** after every step transition using:
```bash
git add tasks/BUILD_PROGRESS.md && git commit -m "build: update progress — <step description>"
```

## Step 0.5 (if BRAINSTORM=true): Design brainstorm

**Skip this step if BRAINSTORM=false.**

1. Launch the `prd-task-planner` agent using the Task tool with:
   - `subagent_type: "prd-task-planner"`
   - Prompt: `MODE: BRAINSTORM\n\n<clean PRD content>`
   - Wait for it to complete. **Save the returned agent ID** — this agent will be resumed in Step 1a.

2. Read `tasks/design-options.md`.

3. Present the design options to the user using `AskUserQuestion`. Build one question per option listed in the file, using the option names as labels and their summaries/trade-offs as descriptions. Include a "Custom direction" option. Ask: "Which design approach should we use for this feature?"

4. Collect the user's chosen option. Store it as `CHOSEN_DESIGN`.

## Step 1: Plan — Two-phase planning with user Q&A

### Step 1a: Discovery — Explore codebase & surface questions

**If BRAINSTORM=true** — resume the agent from Step 0.5:

- `resume: "<agent-id-from-step-0.5>"`
- Prompt: `MODE: DISCOVERY\n\nChosen design direction: <CHOSEN_DESIGN>\n\n<clean PRD content>`
- Tell it to output questions to `tasks/planning-questions.md`
- The agent already has full codebase context from the brainstorm phase — it will skip re-exploration.

**If BRAINSTORM=false** — launch a fresh agent:

- `subagent_type: "prd-task-planner"`
- Prompt: `MODE: DISCOVERY\n\n<PRD content>`
- Tell it to output questions to `tasks/planning-questions.md`

Wait for it to complete. **Save the returned agent ID** — you will resume this agent in Step 1c.

### Step 1b: User Q&A — Present questions and collect answers

1. Read `tasks/planning-questions.md`
2. Present each question to the user using `AskUserQuestion` — use the questions, context, and options from the file to construct clear choices
3. Collect all answers

### Step 1c: Generate — Resume planner with answers

Resume the **same** prd-task-planner agent (using the agent ID from Step 1a) with:

- `resume: "<agent-id-from-step-1a>"`
- Provide all user answers in the prompt, formatted clearly
- Prepend `MODE: GENERATE` to the prompt
- Tell it to generate the updated PRD and task files in `tasks/`

Wait for it to complete. Confirm that task files were created in `tasks/`.

**Commit task files:**
```bash
git add tasks/ && git commit -m "build: add generated task files and PRD"
```

Update `tasks/BUILD_PROGRESS.md` status to reflect GENERATE complete, then commit.

### Step 1d: Task review — Present plan and get approval

This step always runs. Do not skip it.

1. Read all `task-*.md` files from `tasks/`. For each, extract:
   - Task number and title (from filename or `# Task N:` heading)
   - Objective (first line of `## Objective` section)
   - Dependencies (from `## Dependencies` section)

2. Present the full task plan to the user as a formatted list:

   ```
   ## Task Plan (N tasks)

   1. task-01-name — [Objective]
      Dependencies: None
   2. task-02-name — [Objective]
      Dependencies: task-01
   ...
   ```

   Then add: "You can also open and edit any file in `tasks/` directly before proceeding."

3. Use `AskUserQuestion` with a single question: "How would you like to proceed?"
   - **"Looks good — start implementation"** — continue to Step 2
   - **"Regenerate with feedback"** — user provides feedback via the "Other" field

4. **If user approves**: proceed to Step 2.

5. **If user requests regeneration**: resume the **same** prd-task-planner agent (from Step 1a/1c) with:
   - `resume: "<agent-id-from-step-1a>"`
   - Prompt: `MODE: GENERATE\n\nUser feedback on the task plan:\n<feedback>\n\nPlease regenerate the task files incorporating this feedback.`
   - Wait for it to complete, then **loop back to the top of Step 1d** to re-present the updated plan.

## Step 2: Implement — Run parallel-task-orchestrator

Launch the `parallel-task-orchestrator` agent using the Task tool with:

- `subagent_type: "parallel-task-orchestrator"`
- Tell it to read and execute all tasks from `tasks/`
- Include this additional instruction in the prompt:
  > "Run tasks **sequentially** (one at a time, no parallel waves). After each task-implementer completes, commit using the following procedure before starting the next task:
  >
  > **Lock file isolation:** Before committing, check if any lock files were created or modified (e.g., `Cargo.lock`, `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `Gemfile.lock`, `poetry.lock`, `go.sum`, `uv.lock`). If so, commit them **separately first**:
  > ```bash
  > git add <lock-file(s)>
  > git commit -m "chore: update <lock-file-name>"
  > ```
  > This ensures lock file changes are in isolated commits that can be easily skipped or regenerated during rebases.
  >
  > **Then commit remaining changes:**
  > ```bash
  > git add -A
  > git commit -m "feat: <task-objective-from-task-file>"
  > ```
  >
  > Use the task's `## Objective` line as the commit message description.
  >
  > **Update progress:** After each task commit, update `tasks/BUILD_PROGRESS.md` to mark the task as done and commit:
  > ```bash
  > git add tasks/BUILD_PROGRESS.md && git commit -m "build: update progress — task <N> complete"
  > ```"

Wait for it to complete. Note any issues reported.

## Step 2b: Build check — Verify the project compiles

Before reviewing, run a quick build/lint check to catch obvious breakage:

- Look for a `package.json`, `Makefile`, `Cargo.toml`, or similar build config in the project root
- Run the appropriate build command (e.g., `npm run build`, `pnpm build`, `make`, `cargo check`)
- If the build fails, report the errors to the user and ask whether to proceed with the review or fix first
- If no build system is detected, skip this step

## Step 2c: Test verification — Run the project's test suite

After the build check, run the project's full test suite to catch regressions and verify implementation:

- Look for test configuration: `package.json` (check for "test" script), `pytest.ini`/`pyproject.toml`, `go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`, or other test framework config
- Run the appropriate test command (e.g., `npm test`, `pnpm test`, `pytest`, `go test ./...`, `cargo test`)
- If tests fail: report the failures and ask whether to proceed, fix, or skip
- If no test infrastructure is detected, skip this step

## Step 2.5: Auto-commit and PR

**Skip if `AUTO_COMMIT=false`.**

**2.5a Safety:** Run `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`. If `main`/`master`: abort ("Auto-commit aborted: on main/master. Commit manually.") → proceed to Step 3.

**2.5b Commit:**

Per-task commits were already made in Step 2. Skip to push.

**2.5d Push:** `git push -u origin <branch-name>`. On failure, show manual command and continue.

**2.5e PR:** Run `gh auth status 2>/dev/null && echo GH_OK || echo GH_UNAVAILABLE`.

- `GH_OK`: Create PR body (1-2 sentence summary + "## Changes" task objectives + "## Review Notes" placeholder). Run `gh pr create --title "feat: <desc>" --body "<body>" --base main`. Display URL.
- `GH_UNAVAILABLE`: Display ready-to-copy `gh pr create` command.

**2.5f Report:** `Branch: <name> | Commits: <N> | Push: ok/failed | PR: <url or manual>`

## Step 3: Review — Run code-reviewer

Before launching the code-reviewer, check if TDD mode was used by reading any task file from `tasks/` and looking for a `## TDD Mode` section.

Launch the `code-reviewer` agent using the Task tool with:

- `subagent_type: "code-reviewer"`
- Tell it to review all changes against `tasks/updated-prd.md`
- Tell it to write the review report to `tasks/review-report.md`
- **If TDD mode was used**, include these additional review criteria in the prompt:
  - Were tests written for each task that had TDD mode enabled?
  - Do the tests meaningfully cover the acceptance criteria from the task files?
  - Are there tasks with TDD mode that appear to be missing tests?
  - Do tests follow project conventions?
- **If TDD mode was not used**, still tell the reviewer to check general test coverage as part of the standard review

Wait for it to complete.

## Step 3b: Auto-fix — Address critical review issues (one pass)

Read `tasks/review-report.md`. Check if the `### Critical` section contains any items.

**If critical issues are found:**

1. Collect all items listed under `### Critical` (file paths, line numbers, descriptions)
2. For each distinct file affected, launch a `task-implementer` sub-agent (parallel where no file conflicts) with a prompt that includes:
   - The specific critical issue(s) for that file verbatim from the report
   - Instruction to fix only these specific issues, touching no other code
3. Wait for all task-implementers to complete.
4. Re-run the code-reviewer (same criteria as Step 3) **once more** against `tasks/updated-prd.md`. Write the updated report to `tasks/review-report.md` (overwrite).

**If no critical issues:** proceed directly to Step 4.

Do not loop — the auto-fix runs at most once. If critical issues persist after the retry, report them in Step 4.

## Step 3c: Clean up task files

After the review is complete (and any auto-fixes applied), remove the task tracking files and commit:

```bash
rm -rf tasks/
git add -A && git commit -m "build: remove task files — build complete"
```

This keeps the branch history clean while still having the task files available in earlier commits for reference or resumption.

## Step 4: Report

Summarize the full pipeline run to the user:

```
## Build Complete

### Planning
- [X tasks created]

### Implementation
- [tasks completed / total]
- [any issues]

### Build Check
- [passed / failed / skipped]

### Testing
- [test suite status: all passed / X failed / not detected]
- [if TDD: TDD compliance summary]

### Review
- [compliance score]
- [critical issues if any]

### Auto-Commit
- [skipped — not enabled]
  OR
- Branch: <branch-name>
- PR: <url or "manual command displayed">

### Next Steps
- [what the user should do — e.g., run tests, fix issues, deploy]
```

## Rules

- Run the steps **sequentially** — each depends on the previous
- If Step 1 fails (no tasks created), stop and report the issue
- If Step 2 has partial failures, still run Step 3 to review what was completed
- Always run Step 3 — never skip the review
